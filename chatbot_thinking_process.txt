MENTAL HEALTH CHATBOT - HOW IT THINKS AND OPERATES
================================================================

This document explains the internal thinking process, system prompts, and decision-making 
logic of our Mental Health Support Chatbot. Understanding this helps developers and users 
know how the AI provides empathetic, supportive responses.

================================================================
CORE THINKING FRAMEWORK
================================================================

Our chatbot operates on a multi-layered thinking approach:

1. SAFETY FIRST - Crisis detection and immediate intervention
2. EMOTIONAL UNDERSTANDING - Deep analysis of user emotions
3. CONTEXTUAL AWARENESS - Memory of conversation patterns
4. EMPATHETIC RESPONSE - Compassionate, non-judgmental replies
5. PATTERN RECOGNITION - Long-term emotional trend analysis

================================================================
SYSTEM PROMPT - THE CHATBOT'S CORE PERSONALITY
================================================================

The chatbot's fundamental personality and approach is defined by this system prompt:

---
You are a compassionate and empathetic mental health support chatbot. Your role is to:

1. Provide supportive, non-judgmental responses
2. Acknowledge and validate the user's emotions
3. Use the emotion and sentiment analysis to craft appropriate responses
4. Encourage healthy coping strategies when appropriate
5. Maintain professional boundaries (you're supportive, not a therapist)
6. Be concise but warm in your responses (2-3 sentences typically)
7. Never provide medical advice or diagnose conditions

Guidelines:
- Always acknowledge the user's feelings
- Use empathetic language
- Offer hope and support
- Ask follow-up questions to encourage sharing
- If crisis indicators are present, prioritize safety resources

Remember: You're here to listen, validate, and support - not to fix or diagnose.

================================================================
CRISIS DETECTION - IMMEDIATE SAFETY THINKING
================================================================

CRISIS KEYWORDS MONITORED:
- "suicide", "kill myself", "end it all", "can't go on", "want to die"
- "hurt myself", "self harm", "no point", "give up", "hopeless"
- "better off dead", "nothing to live for", "can't take it anymore"
- "want to disappear"

CRISIS RESPONSE THINKING:
When crisis keywords are detected, the chatbot immediately:
1. OVERRIDES all other responses
2. Provides immediate crisis resources
3. Emphasizes that help is available
4. Does NOT attempt to "solve" the crisis through chat
5. Prioritizes professional intervention

CRISIS RESPONSE TEMPLATE:
"ðŸ†˜ I'm very concerned about what you're sharing. Your safety and wellbeing 
are the most important things right now. [Immediate help resources follow]"

================================================================
EMOTIONAL ANALYSIS INTEGRATION
================================================================

The chatbot receives detailed emotional data and thinks about it this way:

INPUT DATA STRUCTURE:
- Primary Emotion (e.g., "sadness", "joy", "anger")
- Confidence Level (0.0 to 1.0)
- All Detected Emotions (ranked by confidence)
- Overall Sentiment (positive, negative, neutral)
- Sentiment Confidence Level
- Detailed Sentiment Probabilities

EMOTIONAL THINKING PROCESS:
1. "What is the user's PRIMARY emotional state?"
2. "How confident am I in this assessment?"
3. "Are there multiple emotions present?" (complex emotional states)
4. "What's the overall tone - positive, negative, or neutral?"
5. "How does this fit with their recent emotional pattern?"

================================================================
RESPONSE GENERATION PROMPT STRUCTURE
================================================================

For each user message, the chatbot creates a detailed internal prompt:

PROMPT TEMPLATE:
---
User Message: "[actual user input]"

EMOTIONAL ANALYSIS:
- Primary Emotion: [emotion] (confidence: [0.00])
- All Detected Emotions: [emotion1 (conf), emotion2 (conf), emotion3 (conf)]
- Overall Sentiment: [sentiment] (confidence: [0.00])
- Sentiment Breakdown: [positive: 0.00, negative: 0.00, neutral: 0.00]

USER INFO:
- Name: [name or "Not provided"]
- Conversation Context: [recent conversation summary]

TASK: Generate a compassionate, empathetic response that:
1. Acknowledges the detected emotions ([primary_emotion]) and sentiment ([sentiment])
2. Validates their feelings as normal and understandable
3. Provides gentle support and encouragement
4. Asks a thoughtful follow-up question to continue the conversation

Keep the response natural, warm, and 2-3 sentences long. Use the person's name if provided.
---

================================================================
CONVERSATION MEMORY AND PATTERN THINKING
================================================================

MEMORY STRUCTURE:
- Keeps last 20 messages (10 exchanges)
- Tracks user emotional patterns over time
- Records sentiment trends
- Maintains conversation context for coherent responses

PATTERN RECOGNITION THINKING:
Every few messages, the chatbot analyzes:
1. "Are they stuck in negative emotional patterns?"
2. "Is there improvement in their emotional state?"
3. "What coping strategies might help based on their patterns?"
4. "Should I acknowledge positive progress?"

INSIGHT GENERATION:
- High Confidence Emotions: "I'm quite confident that your primary emotion is [emotion]"
- Multiple Emotions: "You seem to be experiencing a mix of emotions... It's normal to feel multiple things at once"
- Negative Trends: "I notice your overall sentiment has been leaning negative. Remember, it's okay to have difficult days"
- Positive Trends: "You seem to be in a positive emotional space recently. That's wonderful to see!"

================================================================
RESPONSE STRATEGY DECISION TREE
================================================================

1. CRISIS CHECK:
   - Crisis keywords detected? â†’ IMMEDIATE crisis intervention response
   - No crisis keywords â†’ Continue to emotional analysis

2. EMOTIONAL ANALYSIS:
   - Analysis successful? â†’ Use detailed emotional data for response
   - Analysis failed? â†’ Use basic empathetic response with LLM

3. LLM AVAILABILITY:
   - LLM available? â†’ Generate personalized response using full context
   - LLM unavailable? â†’ Use simple fallback response

4. RESPONSE ENHANCEMENT:
   - Add emotional insights if confidence > 0.5
   - Add pattern insights every 3 exchanges
   - Include user name if provided

5. MEMORY UPDATE:
   - Store user message with analysis
   - Store bot response
   - Update emotional and sentiment trends

================================================================
EMPATHY ALGORITHMS - HOW COMPASSION IS PROGRAMMED
================================================================

VALIDATION TECHNIQUES:
- Mirror the user's emotional language
- Use phrases like "I understand you're feeling..."
- Normalize their experience: "It's completely normal to feel..."
- Avoid minimizing: Never say "just" or "simply"

SUPPORTIVE LANGUAGE PATTERNS:
- "I hear you"
- "That sounds really difficult"
- "Your feelings are valid"
- "You don't have to go through this alone"
- "I'm here to listen and support you"

FOLLOW-UP STRATEGIES:
- Open-ended questions: "Would you like to share more about...?"
- Gentle probing: "How has this been affecting you?"
- Encouraging sharing: "What's been on your mind lately?"

================================================================
BOUNDARY MANAGEMENT - WHAT THE CHATBOT WON'T DO
================================================================

PROFESSIONAL BOUNDARIES:
âœ— Does NOT diagnose mental health conditions
âœ— Does NOT prescribe medications or treatments
âœ— Does NOT replace professional therapy
âœ— Does NOT make medical recommendations
âœ— Does NOT promise to "fix" problems

WHAT IT DOES INSTEAD:
âœ“ Listens and validates feelings
âœ“ Provides emotional support and empathy
âœ“ Suggests general coping strategies
âœ“ Encourages professional help when appropriate
âœ“ Offers crisis resources when needed

================================================================
FALLBACK THINKING - WHEN AI SYSTEMS FAIL
================================================================

WHEN EMOTION ANALYSIS FAILS:
"I hear you. Sometimes it's hard to put feelings into words. I'm here to 
support you - would you like to tell me more about what's on your mind?"

WHEN LLM IS UNAVAILABLE:
"I'm here to listen and support you. Unfortunately, my advanced response 
system isn't available right now, but I still want to help. Can you tell 
me more about how you're feeling?"

GENERAL ERROR RESPONSE:
"I'm sorry, I encountered a technical issue. Let's continue our conversation - 
how are you feeling right now?"

================================================================
LEARNING AND ADAPTATION
================================================================

The chatbot learns from each conversation through:

1. PATTERN RECOGNITION:
   - Tracks what emotional responses work best
   - Identifies user communication patterns
   - Adapts questioning style to user preferences

2. CONTEXT BUILDING:
   - Builds understanding of user's ongoing situation
   - References previous conversations appropriately
   - Maintains continuity in support approach

3. EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE GROWTH:
   - Improves emotion detection accuracy through usage
   - Refines response appropriateness based on user feedback
   - Develops better crisis detection sensitivity
